dotfiles
========

These are my dotfiles, managed by stow.

== Quick partial (X)ubuntu setup (requires curl):

    apt install curl
    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laher/dotfiles/master/setup-ubuntu.sh)

== Quick partial Mac setup (requires brew):

Get brew from https://brew.sh . Then:

    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laher/dotfiles/master/setup-mac.sh)

== Full installation:

   cd ~/
   git clone https://github.com/laher/dotfiles
   cd dotfiles
   ./setup-ubuntu.sh (or ./setup-mac.sh)
   ./setup-pt2.sh

== Sync:

   crontab -e

Add this line (Linux) to keep things synced:

   0 10,17 * * * ~/dotfiles/sync.sh || notify-send "~/dotfiles/sync.sh" "Failed to sync dotfiles (via crontab)"
